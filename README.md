TLDR: a game about beating a internet menace with progress bars

### Storyline
In a labratory, several scientists test out groundbreaking technology that will allow physical lifeforms to be transfered into a virtural reality on the internet. Tests began with single-cell organisms, then worms, then animals, and now on this day, a human named Riley was transported into a sandbox in this new reality. However, he had malicious intent, as he knew about a security flaw that he could exploit. After a while, the scientists realize a major error.

```ERROR: Subject "Riley" exited the sandbox. Subject is on the open internet.```

As they saw this error, all computers in the lab crash, and once they restarted, Riley has became so powerfull (might as well call him the internet god.)
Over the next few hours, almost all computer become infected under his new virus. Riley now has a internet empire.

A week later, Amidst the chaos, One of your friends was working on something: a unique app designed to cure infected machines and machines connecting to it from Riley's empire. However, Riley anticipated such a countermeasure and programmed the infected devices to resist the antivirus app, creating a seemingly insurmountable challenge.

But your friend had a catch, a manual mode that you to basically "attack" the virus and "defend" the application's job. And because he has to update this powerful cure, he cant go and manually cure every machine, but you can.
You now have an oppertunity to save the internet, and the modern world as we know it. **Are YOU up for the challenge?**
